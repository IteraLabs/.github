## Hello and welcome

At the forefront of blockchain technology, quantitative modeling, and decentralized finance (DeFi), this organization performs research and development for open source projects in three core areas: blockchain Modeling and Data ETL, Financial Machine Learning For Quantitative Modeling, Distributed Computing and Machine Learning for GenAI.

Some of the current project we work on are: 

- [Atelier](https://github.com/iteralabs/atelier): A Computational Framework/Engine for Market Microstructure High Frequency Modeling, Synthetic Simulation and Historical Market Reconstruction/Replay.
- [Traderman](https://github.com/iteralabs/traderman): A Python SDK to build, train, stress-test, deploy and monitor trading strategies.
- [Molina](https://github.com/iteralabs/molina): A Rust and Python Synthetic Integration for an agentic-LLM approach to build a research agent for local knowledge representation.
