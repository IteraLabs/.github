At Iteralabs we believe in one core principle: To achieve consequential engineering results, science goes before hype.

And thus, we focus on statistical soundness and parametric stability for the models we use, with this hierarchical sourcing of knowledge: *statistical* learning > *machine* > *large heuristics* learning (Generative AI, which we could use, even daily, but as an optional tool not as a protagonistically, for-its-own-sake goal).
